# Auth

This in my implementation of the auth functions honestly its pretty straight forward because of the package I've added. but I'm trying to word what I want to get done to help me think it out.

## Tests

right now I've got the basic hashing algo that I just added. odviously I'm going to make sure that works. For now I'm thinking of creating a couple tests that just dont use the proper salt or password and check if it failes or not. Should be simple mostly just testing the package and getting used to the auth not to hard.
